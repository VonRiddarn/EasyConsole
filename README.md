<p align="center">Easy to use library to handle graphics, inputs and menus in your .NET console project.</p>

## \>IMPORTANT NOTICE_
This is a dead library.<br/>
I started to make this as a testimony to my abilities in C# and eventually lost interests.<br/>
I only re-uploaded this repository as it can still be used as a receipt of my knowledge.<br/>
The project is still riddled with things I wanted to fix and never got around to change.

## \>About_

This is a simple library containing tools that makes it <span style="color:blue">easy</span> to develop nice looking and responsive .NET console applications.<br/>
The library is written in .NET 6.0 and has not been checked for backwards compatibility, <s>it should however run smoothly on any and all versions of .NET & .NET Core.</s> It will be rewritten for backwards compability soon.</br>

## \>What you can achieve_

<s>Note: These screenshots are old and do not fully represent the state of the library.
For the best understanding look through the source.
The source is sadly uncommented as of now, but that will be fixed later this week.</s><br/>
